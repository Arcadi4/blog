# Building with Next.js

Next.js has become one of the most popular React frameworks, and for good reason.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides several key benefits:

### 1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

Server-side rendering improves performance and SEO by rendering pages on the server before sending them to the client.

### 2. Static Site Generation (SSG)

Generate static HTML at build time for even better performance.

### 3. File-Based Routing

The file system becomes your routing system - simple and intuitive.

### 4. API Routes

Build your API endpoints right alongside your frontend code.

## The App Router

The new App Router brings:

- Improved layouts
- Server Components by default
- Simplified data fetching
- Better code organization

## Conclusion

Next.js makes it easy to build fast, modern web applications. Give it a try for your next project!
